// An array is like a fence post with slats. The don't have to contain the same data. But they do contain the same data type.
// You declare Arrays by typing String [] (bracets make an array) Players....Jen, Jim, Jan, Jerry (All are different points in an array)
// For each datatype with this name insdide you should call out the parameter
// You can change the size of your array without changing your code.
//Arrays help you organize storage that you would otherwise have to code each one by one.
//looping is like the word says, a loop or something that goes and functions again and again. They are used to abriviate and to repeat true statements. It also helps shorten the code
